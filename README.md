# About Brad

Just a guy in Alabama trying to build software from a cattle farm. Most of what you'd want to know can be found at [bradonomics.com](https://bradonomics.com/?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=brad_github_profile).

## What I'm workng on

Last year I started working through [The Pragmatic Studio's](https://pragmaticstudio.com/) Ruby and Rails courses. After that I decided I'd build an Instapaper clone called Portholes. I'm now working my way through Michael Hartl's book [The Ruby on Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book).

If you know someone looking for a Ruby on Rails developer, tell them you know a guy.

## Find me around the web

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brad-west/), but the best way to keep up with what I'm doing is [my website](https://bradonomics.com/?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=brad_github_profile).
